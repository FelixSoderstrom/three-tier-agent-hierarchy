      "narrative": "I spawned the sixth and final team-lead with anticipation—this would transform raw functionality into polished educational product. The logs showed the team-lead verifying all five previous completion files existed. This was critical: Epic 6 was responsible for ALL documentation (Epics 1-5 created none). I watched as three specialists were spawned: Web Interface Specialist, Documentation Writer, and Integration Tester. This epic would take longer—creating index.html and learn.html, writing six documentation files (INSTALL.md, CONFIGURATION.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md, TECHNICAL_SPECS.md, EDUCATOR_GUIDE.md, README.md), testing end-to-end. Hours passed. I saw HTML files appear with dark theme (#1a1a1a background, #ff6b35 orange accents, #ffffff white text). Documentation files materialized one by one, each comprehensive and professional. The integration tester ran through setup flows, notebook execution, evaluation system. When .epic6_complete.json appeared, I reviewed everything: professional web interface, complete documentation suite, successful end-to-end tests. The project was ready for students. Felix's automated development challenge was nearly complete.",

      "narrative": "I was the final team-lead, tasked with creating the user-facing experience. My first critical action: verify ALL previous completion files existed. I checked .epic1_complete.json through .epic5_complete.json—all present, all showing 'completed: true'. The infrastructure was solid. My mission was dual: create professional web interface and write comprehensive documentation. This was the largest scope yet: 2 HTML files, 6 documentation files, complete testing. I consulted the meta-agent, spawning three specialists. To the Web Interface Specialist: 'Create index.html as navigation hub with welcome, documentation links, lesson launch, setup validation. Create learn.html for lesson preparation with attention theory, mathematics, visual explanations. Use dark theme: #1a1a1a background, #ff6b35 orange accents, #ffffff white text. Professional, minimalist, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA).' To the Documentation Writer: 'Write INSTALL.md (installation), CONFIGURATION.md (LLM setup), TROUBLESHOOTING.md (common issues), TECHNICAL_SPECS.md (system requirements), EDUCATOR_GUIDE.md (instructor guide), update README.md (project overview). Make comprehensive and professional.' To the Integration Tester: 'Validate complete system: setup flow, notebook execution, evaluation, documentation accuracy, web links.' I coordinated their work, ensuring consistency. When all reported completion, I compiled .epic6_complete.json—the final epic completion file.",

        "narrative": "I was tasked with creating the professional entry point. File 1: index.html. I designed a navigation hub with sections: Welcome (project overview, learning objectives), Documentation (links to all 6 .md files), Getting Started (link to learn.html, environment setup instructions), Launch Lesson (button to start Jupyter), Setup Validation (checks for Python, dependencies, notebooks). The design followed specifications exactly: background #1a1a1a (dark charcoal), headings and accents #ff6b35 (vibrant orange), body text #ffffff (white), secondary text #cccccc (light gray). I used system fonts for fast loading, flexbox for responsive layout, CSS grid for documentation links. Accessibility: semantic HTML5, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast (4.5:1). File 2: learn.html. This was pure education: Section 1: What is Attention? (intuitive explanation), Section 2: The Mathematics (Q, K, V projections, scaled dot-product, softmax), Section 3: Visual Intuition (attention as weighted lookup), Section 4: What You'll Implement (preview of 4 sections), Section 5: Prerequisites (Python, PyTorch basics). I included SVG diagrams showing attention architecture. Same dark theme, same accessibility standards. Navigation: header with link back to index.html. The interface was professional, clean, and ready for educational institutions.",
