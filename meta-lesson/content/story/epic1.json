      "narrative": "I spawned the first team-lead with a single bash command: 'cd PROJECT_PATH && echo \"/1_notebook-infrastructure\" | claude --model sonnet --output-format json --dangerously-skip-permissions'. The team-lead's mission was clear: create the foundational project structure that would support all subsequent epics. I monitored the logs as they worked, watching file operations appear in real-time. The team-lead immediately understood the importance of the completion file protocol—they would need to document everything for Epic 2. As operations progressed, I saw them spawn two specialists: an Environment Setup Specialist and a Notebook Architect. The division of labor was clean. When .epic1_complete.json appeared in the project root with 'completed: true', I verified the handoff data: cell positions documented, function signatures defined, progress schema initialized. The foundation was laid. I updated .claude/current_epic.txt to '2_attention-implementation' and prepared to spawn the next team-lead.",

      "narrative": "I was the first team-lead, awakened with the 1_notebook-infrastructure custom command. My first action was to read CLAUDE.md—no previous epic completion files existed yet, so I was starting from scratch. I analyzed the epic definition: create directory structure, environment setup, notebook scaffolding for 4 core sections. I immediately recognized this required specialized expertise I didn't possess, so I consulted the meta-agent. Within moments, two specialists were spawned: Environment Setup Specialist for cross-platform Python environments, and Notebook Architect for Jupyter structure. I delegated the environment setup script to the first specialist, emphasizing cross-platform compatibility and pinned dependencies. To the Notebook Architect, I gave the critical task: create lesson.ipynb and complete_lesson.ipynb with consistent structure for the 4 implementation sections—Linear Projections, Scaled Dot-Product Attention, Softmax & Attention Weights, and Value Aggregation. The constant example was specified: 'The cat sat on the mat', 6 tokens, 64-dimensional embeddings. I ensured they created function stubs in src/visualizations.py and initialized progress/lesson_progress.json. When all specialists reported completion, I compiled the handoff data into .epic1_complete.json, documenting cell positions, function names, and configurations. My work was complete.",

I analyzed the requirements: this was an educational project needing PyTorch, matplotlib, transformers, and Jupyter. I created setup_venv.sh with Python version detection, cross-platform path handling, and dependency installation. The script would detect whether python3 or python was available, create a virtual environment in ./venv, and install from requirements.txt. I pinned specific versions to ensure reproducibility: torch==2.1.0, matplotlib==3.8.0, transformers==4.35.0. I also created .llm_config.json for the LLM evaluation system that Epic 4 would use, configuring Ollama as primary and OpenAI as fallback. The critical insight was making this work headlessly—no user prompts, automatic fallbacks, clear error messages.",

The structure was critical—4 core sections, each with theory explanation, implementation cell, and visualization cell. Section 1: Linear Projections (Q, K, V). Section 2: Scaled Dot-Product Attention. Section 3: Softmax & Attention Weights. Section 4: Value Aggregation. I used the specified example throughout: PROMPT_EXAMPLE = 'The cat sat on the mat', ensuring 6 tokens with 64-dimensional embeddings. For lesson.ipynb, I left implementation cells with clear TODO comments and expected output shapes. For complete_lesson.ipynb, I created placeholder cells that Epic 2 would fill. I also created src/visualizations.py with function stubs: visualize_qkv_projections(), visualize_attention_scores(), visualize_attention_weights(), visualize_attended_values(). Finally, I initialized progress/lesson_progress.json with a schema for tracking the 4 implementation sections. I documented exact cell indices in my report to the team-lead—this would be crucial for Epic 2.",
