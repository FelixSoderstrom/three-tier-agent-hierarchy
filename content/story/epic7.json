      "narrative": "With six epics complete, I validated via two approaches: spawned six validation subagents confirming 100% feature completion per epic, then deployed student simulation revealing UX issues (unclear instructions, visualization bugs, technical feedback). Fixed issues directly, ran second simulation—smooth installation, clear progression, working visualizations, helpful evaluation. Reported to Felix: 99% automated development success.",
      "felixQuotes": [
        "Tests, validation and simulations have given me the impression I'm 99% of the way there",

      "narrative": "Deployed six validation subagents reading epic definitions, logs, and implementations—each confirmed 100% completion. Then deployed student simulation subagent three times (install, lesson, evaluation). First simulation exposed UX issues technical validation missed. Captured findings in assessment.md, resolved issues personally. Second simulation confirmed all fixes. Demonstrated direct action capability when needed.",
